'Die Ewige Liste' is a small private project I created as a turn timer and scoreboard for the Backgammon game. 
However, it could be used for similar game types, like chess, just as well. Actually, the idea for the app originates in 
chess turn timers. Backgammon isn't usually played with a turn timer but I wanted to give it a try and make the game more 
challenging. 
The main feature of the app is the turn timer which is a common element in timed chess games. It keeps track of the total time 
a player takes to finish the match. So, when a game is finished there will be one player who won the game itself 
('game winner') and one player who took less time to finish the game ('time winner'). Both wins grant a certain amount of 
points which the user can adjust to personal preferences. The list view keeps track of the earned points and played matches 
which allows ongoing comparison between two players - hence the working title 'Die Ewige Liste' ('The Eternal List').
Besides the basic game information, like who won and how long it took, the app collects additional information like who 
played which color or who began the game. In future, this data can be used to create statistics like "The beginning player 
wins 59% of the games".
Some other features, like a penalty system in case one player makes a mistake, are already implemented/in progress/planned.

The project is to be considered work in progress.
